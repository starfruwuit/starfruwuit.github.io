    <h2>UCR Spring Fling: May 2025</h2>
    <p>Saloon Sweeper debuted at the UCR Spring Fling on May 31, 2025. 
    I was immediately surprised by how well it moved during safety and failsafe testing, 
    despite having never moved or been tested before. It drove! In almost a straight line! 
    There were problems throughout the event, which is to be expected, but overall I was 
    extremely satisfied with its performance.

    <h3>Fairy Rumble</h3>
    <p>I was really excited for the fairy rumble because it would give me a chance to see
        more of what Saloon Sweeper could do. Unfortunately, and hilariously, Saloon Sweeper 
        ended up spending nearly the entire rumble entangled with a greedy-snake style bot, named

    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
    <p>I'm very proud of how Saloon Sweeper performed at this event. I messaged Alex 
        Price of Team Good Team about the strange spinup issues it was having and she 
        recommended a torquier motor and a 3S battery rather than the 2S I was running. 
        For version 2, I definitely want to follow this advice, and will either run the 
        new Repeat Robotics Fairy Motor, or the one she runs in Pink Elephants on Parade.
