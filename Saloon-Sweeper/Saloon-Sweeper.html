<h1>Saloon Sweeper: Vibration-Driven Bristle Bot</h1>

<h2>Saloon Sweeper Ideation</h2>
<p>Saloon Sweeper will be a Fairyweight horizontal spinner with no wheels, relying entirely on the vibration from its
    unbalanced weapon and its bristles for movement. </p>
<h2>What is a Bristle Bot?</h2>
<img src="orangeHexbug.png" width="200" alt="an orange HexBug toy">
<p>Bristle bots use offset spinning weights in order to generate vibration, and "bristles" (in combat robotics, bristles
    are often taken from toothbrushes or printed out of TPU), to increase the relative coefficient of friction in one
    direction, and propel the bot forward.

    Bot" by Chandravamsi Gandra</a></span>
    was a very helpful resource for deepening my understanding of how bristle bots work, and how to design one.</p>
<h2>Why is a Bristle Bot?</h2>
<p>In combat robotics, bots using nontraditional methods of locomotion are granted a weight bonus, in order to encourage
new designs and keep the sport interesting. Bristle-drive robots are awarded a 150% bonus, so instead of the
Fairyweight class' usual 150 grams, Saloon Sweeper will be able to weigh up to 225 grams. </p>
