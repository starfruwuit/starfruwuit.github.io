    <li>using Repeat Max motors for drive</li>
    <li><span class="textlink"><a href="/ReBoot/UHMWtoVytaflex.html">cast Vytaflex polyurethane over the bottoms of the UHMW boots</a></span> </li>
    <li>machined spacers for the weapon and shuffler pods</li>
</ol>
<p>These changes were all desperately needed, based on how ReBoot had come together at the Sun Devil Smackdown. Replacing the drone 
    motors and TPU gears with Repeat Maxes was a much sturdier and more reliable choice, and provided a flat surface for the 
    CAMs to lock onto. The Vytaflex casting on the boots gaven them traction that the bare UHMW would never have been able to achieve. 
    The machined spacer for the weapon shaft was a big upgrade from the threaded spacer that used to hold the weapon, which I had 
    chosen for cost-effectiveness but later realized it was a great pain to unscrew. The machined spacer for the shuffler pods replaced 
    earlier 3D-printed versions which would have been extremely fragile due to their thinness.

<h2>Norwalk Havoc Robot League: March 2024</h2>
<p>The leadup to Norwalk, ReBoot's first real competition, was hectic. I was going along with a group for Combat
Ready Robotics' annual trip, along with 11 others, some competing, some spectating. I had about six weeks to completely redesign and
rebuild ReBoot, and even thought he laser-cut parts arrived the night we were going to fly out, I went into the competition 
confident in the changes I'd made. </p>

the "shuffle shields")â€”the </p>
