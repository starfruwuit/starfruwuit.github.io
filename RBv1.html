<h1>ReBoot v1</h1>
<h2>conception</h2>
<p>ReBoot was first conceived in December of 2023, as the semester ended and my friends prepared for Arizona
  Robotic Combat's latest competition. The first kernel of a concept for this robot that entered my head was
    the boot-shaped shuffler feet, and, not knowing much about shuffle mechanisms at the time, I sketched out this
    first thought in the Notes app on my phone: </p>

<p>I also sketched out a concept for the rest of the robot: a disc vertical spinner, inspired by the likes of
    Synthesis and Ripperoni: </p>

<p>I planned to debut ReBoot version 1 at the SunDevil Smackdown hosted by Combat Robotics on January 20th, 2024.
However, this was the first beetleweight robot I'd designed on my own, and the design had several places where it
needed to be refined. The boots were made of bare UHMW, which would have no traction; the CAM-shaft was a long number-six
bolt; the chassis was a nightmare to assemble. On the day of the Smackdown, I spent most of the day trying to get the
robot together, then ultimately gave up so I could have fun spectating the last couple matches. I left Smackdown with a
long list of things to improve and work on.</p>
