    <li>complete redesign of chassis, with decreased width allowing it to be printed in one piece rather than three</li>
    <li>raised weapon motor</li>
    <li>moved wiring harness to the bottom, rather than the top, to protect wires from hits to the top plate</li>
    <li>UHMW "wheel guards" instead of nylon</li>

ReBoot is upside-down, and through its clear polycarbonate bottom plate, its battery, wiring, and a couple of lights
are visible." title="ReBoot vs. Guacamole">
    <p>The biggest change to ReBoot between UCR's Spring Fling and ARC's RoboRumble was the addition of machined
        aluminum CAMs. The previous iterations of the CAMs were a frustrating source of seemingly endless drive issues,
    where the bot would often decide to either spend the match crab-walking or not move at all. </p>
    <p>But no more!</p>

         title="aluminum CAM">
    <p>With its new aluminum CAMs--one on each side was enough--ReBoot's drive issues were gone. It drove like it
    should, and it was <span style="font-style: italic">fast</span>. I didn't mind losing both matches at all--I was
    just overjoyed that neither of those losses had been forfeits.</p>

  <h2>EVAC Cactus Clash: November 2024</h2>
    <p>ReBoot underwent two major changes in preparation for EVAC's first event: first, a new set of boots, with
    Vytaflex cast on both the top and bottom, to assist in driving upside down; and second, the addition of magnets
    underneath its bottom plate.</p>
    <p>The EVAC Cactus Clash was the last event for ReBoot v3, and oh, what a way to go. ReBoot was thoroughly wrecked
    in this <span class="textlink"><a href="https://challonge.com/EVAC_2024">bracket</a></span>,
    first by Three Tapper and then by Fruit Punch. These two fights revealed some finer points of weakness in
    ReBoot, now that I had solved the issues of "it doesn't drive" and "it gets stuck upside down." In these fights,
    ReBoot constantly loses the ground game, often getting flipped up into the air and losing valuable time and points
    as it tries to right itself. The points of failure in both fights were the same: the shuffle shields would detach
    from the chassis at one side or another (likely the result of the threads formed in the chassis by the plastite
    screws being worn out), and the bottom plate would shatter under the intense impacts doled out by these two
    heavy hitters.</p>
    <h3>ReBoot vs. Three Tapper</h3>
    <p>The fight against Three Tapper was rough for ReBoot, and made even rougher by me not noticing before the match
    that ReBoot's weapon ESC had unplugged itself from the receiver. </p>
