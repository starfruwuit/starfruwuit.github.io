<p>ReBoot is my beetleweight (3lb weight class) combat robot! It uses shufflers to move instead of wheels, and
it has a double vertical spinner. I've been designing, competing with, and continually improving ReBoot since December
    2023. Click
    <span class="textlink"><a href="https://www.robotcombatevents.com/groups/2966/resources/10805" target="_blank">here</a></span>
    for the information on its performance at recent tournaments, as well as any tournaments it's signed up for
    in the near future!</p>
<p>The most complete section of this webpage is the one pertaining to version 3, as that is the most recent version,
and the one I spent the most time working on.</p>
