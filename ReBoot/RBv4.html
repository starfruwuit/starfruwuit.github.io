<h2>changes from v3</h2>
<p>ReBoot version 4 is a redesign for increased durability and weight-efficiency, especially considering the revision to
the SPARC rules (v1.5), which changes the nontraditional locomotion weight bonus for shuffler-type bots from 150%
to 125%. This means ReBoot version 4 will have to be 0.75 pounds lighter than its previous versions, a great opportunity
    to reduce the amount of air inside the bot. The fourth overhaul redesign will be built around these
    major changes: </p>
<ol>
    <li>raise weapon motor to just above the back of the bot, in order to decrease the dimension along the frontal axis</li>
    <li>lower weapon to move bottom point of rotation closer to ground, and decrease height of uprights</li>
    <li>decrease height of upright ears</li>
    <li>decrease number of standoffs holding "sandwich" together</li>
    <li>redesign and re-machine metal CAMs</li>
    <li>decrease height of chassis</li>
</ol>
