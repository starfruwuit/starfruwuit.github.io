<h1>Wrangler: Greedy-Snake mechanism PLant</h1>
<p>When I traveled to Utah in May 2024 for the UCR
 Spring Fling, a couple friends and I agreed to throw three PLants into the ring as a multibot for the competition's
 PLeetle (Plastic Beetleweight) class. Wrangler v1 was designed for this event, and even though it didn't end up
competing with the Three PLants in a Trenchcoat multibot, I kept working at it.</p>
