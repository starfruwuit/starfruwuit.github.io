<p>Wrangler version 1 was more of a version zero, honestly. Relatively unfamiliar with 3D printing tolerances for
    stiffer materials like PLA+, I undersized the clearances significantly, to the point where it wasn't able to be
assembled without significant filing and drilling out all the holes. The night before the UCR Spring Fling, the two
other members of the Three PLants in a trenchcoat team and I were working at this filing and drilling, when we decided
 to go with a backup plan (or backup PLant)—another bot designed by a friend of ours, called Li'l PLant Guy. Li'l PLant
Guy was a type of bot that the community refers to as a "doorstop wedge"—a wedge-type robot with two wheels and no
    active weapon, shaped like a doorstop. They're generally uncomplicated, reliable bots. Li'l PLant guy performed
    impressively in that event, and was a lot of fun to drive. </p>
