<p>Wrangler v3 was a complete redesign, a response to Wrangler v2 being dangerously close to the 1-pound weight limit
at the Orange County Maker Faire. The biggest change was a redesign of the lifter mechanism, in which the Ranglebox
gearmotor was moved to the top of the bot, allowing me to decrease the body's dimensions significantly. This design
also allowed me to assemble the lifter and the body of the bot separately, which was convenient. </p>

        Assembling Wrangler prior to this event revealed multiple issues, giving me things to iterate upon before the
        fights even started. Again I had undersized many of the holes, so Wrangler's parts required filing, drilling,
        and sanding before they could be persuaded to fit together. Second, one of the features on the top plate, to
        which the lifting mechanism attached, broke off while trying to screw in the lifting mechanism, so the lifter
        was somewhat off-kilter the entire event. Lastly, the inside of the chassis was too small, and I was barely
        able to fit the electronics and battery inside. The fit was so tight that after a couple battery changes,
        the bottom plate cracked open.

    Wrangler v3.1 will be very similar to v3.0, but with a slightly expanded chassis size to better accommodate the
    wiring and battery. The tabs which mount the lifter mechanism to the top plate will also be thicker, and also
    will likely be printed as a separate part from the top plate, with a stronger print orientation.
