<h2>changes from v3</h2>
<p>ReBoot version 4 is a redesign for increased durability and weight-efficiency, especially considering the revision to
the SPARC rules (v1.5???), which changes the nontraditional locomotion weight bonus for shuffler-type bots from 150%
t0 125%. This means ReBoot version 4 would have to cut 0.75 pounds, a great opportunity to reduce the amount of air
inside the bot. The fourth overhaul redesign was built around these major changes: </p>
<ol>
    <li>raise weapon motor to just above the back of the bot, in order to decrease the dimension along the frontal axis</li>
    <li>lower weapon to move bottom point of rotation closer to ground, and decrease height of uprights</li>
    <li>decrease height of upright ears</li>
    <li>decrease number of standoffs holding "sandwich" together</li>
    <li>redesign and re-machine metal CAMs</li>
    <li>decrease height of chassis</li>
</ol>
