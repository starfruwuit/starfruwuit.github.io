<h1>casting Vytaflex onto UHMW</h1>
<p>Ultra-high Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMW-PE, or UHMW for short) is a tough white plastic with a very low
coefficient of friction and a tendency to chip on impact instead of warping, making it ideal for a number of combat
robotics applications. I use it for ReBoot's shuffler feet, but the same slipperiness which makes it a great bearing
surface also would have terrible traction on arena floors if left bare, as in ReBoot version 1.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vytaflex polyurethane is a favorite in the combat robotics community for its high coefficient of friction,
durability, and ease of application. However, there was one major obstacle to connecting these two materials: the long
molecular bonds that give UHMW its slipperiness also make it near-impossible for it to adhere to other substances,
even paint.</p>
