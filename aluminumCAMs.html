<h2>design</h2>
<p>The aluminum CAMs are designed to be slightly longer in teh axial direction than the boots are thick, allowing the
assembly to avoid putting unnecessary friction between the flange of the CAM and the side of the boots. They have one
slip-fit hole for the six-millimeter motor shaft, and two countersunk and tapped holes to attach it to other CAMs at
a 120-degree angle, either on the right or left side. There is also an 0.080" thick flange to keep each boot in its
place. </p>
