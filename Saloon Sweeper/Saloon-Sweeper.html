<h1>Saloon Sweeper: Vibration-Driven Bristle Bot</h1>
<!-- image goes here! if i had one :( -->
<h2>What is a Bristle Bot?</h2>
<!-- image of hex bug maybe -->
<p>Bristle bots use offset spinning weights in order to generate vibration, and "bristles," often taken from
    toothbrushes or printed out of TPU, to increase the relative coefficient of friction in one direction, and propel
    themselves forward.
    <span class="textlink"><a href="https://open.clemson.edu/all_theses/3149/">"Dynamics of a Vibration-Driven Bristle
    Bot" by Chandravamsi Gandra</a></span>
    was a very helpful resource for deepening my understanding of how bristle bots work, and how to design one.</p>
<h2>Why is a Bristle Bot?</h2>
<p>In combat robotics, bots using nontraditional methods of locomotion are granted a weight bonus, in order to encourage
new designs and keep the sport interesting. Bristle-drive robots are awarded a 150% bonus, so instead of the
Fairyweight class' usual 150 grams, Saloon Sweeper will be able to weigh up to 225 grams. </p>
