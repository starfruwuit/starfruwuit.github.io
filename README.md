# STARFRUWUIT WEBSITE!
a website for me!
### to-dos: 
- divide main page structure into "combat robotics," "miscellaneous projects," "school projects," and "work projects"
- move github link higher up on main page
- add a patterned background to main page; maybe a gradient of some kind?
- word art / cooler fonts for title pages -- sriracha font?
-
